		<b>Nursing</b>, is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities <br>so they mayattain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life.[1] Nurses may be differentiated from other <br>health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. Nurses practice in many specialties <br>with differing levels of prescription authority. Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare <br>environments;[2][3] but there is evidence of international shortages of qualified nurses.[4] Many nurses provide care within <br>the ordering scope of physicians, and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers. Nurse  <br>practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing. They are however permitted by most <br>jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings. Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone <br>a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations<br> and provider roles are changing.[5][6]
