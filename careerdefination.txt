Nursing, is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities
so they mayattain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life.[1] Nurses may be differentiated from other
health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. Nurses practice in many specialties
with differing levels of prescription authority. Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare
environments;[2][3] but there is evidence of international shortages of qualified nurses.[4] Many nurses provide care within
the ordering scope of physicians, and this traditional role has shaped the public image of nurses as care providers. Nurse
practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing. They are however permitted by most
jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings. Since the postwar period, nurse education has undergone
a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations
and provider roles are changing.[5][6]
